# Eartag-Jetson
This repository contains several pipelines for our Labby x Jetson integration, focused on deploying computer vision models optimized for real-time inference on the Jetson Orin Nano. This guide will be focused on the [Seed Studio J401 Carrier Board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J401-Carrier-Board-for-Jetson-Orin-NX-Orin-Nano-p-5636.html?srsltid=AfmBOooAkb-AXaLjTLzwR_bd8hEQg_XqoU2tUUa1oWQuXeJkGLJrSoZP). This process will 

## Assemble Hardware
1. Install fan onto the Orin Nano computing module, the metal mounting bracket is to be placed on the bottom of the module, and the fan on the top. A video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKADTqkG538).
2. Unscrew the two computing module mounting screws on the carrier board. They should be on the opposite side of the I/O ports, one is  next to the Control and UART Header, and the other is located next to the CAN Header. See here: ![J401](src/eartag_jetson/resources/j401.png)
3. Slide in the computing module into the 260 PIN SODIMM until it clicks into place, you may have to move the side clips out of the way before you slide the Orin Nano module in.
4. Install storage on the bottom of the board in the M.2 KEY M slot
 
## Flash Jetpack OS onto board (Original guide here)
You can feel free to follow the original guide, but the condensed steps for this specific setup, Jetpack 6.2 w/ the J401 are [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_J4012_Flash_Jetpack/).
1. To do this, you need a Ubuntu Host Computer running Ubuntu 22.04 since this is directly compatible with Jetpack 6.2, for this I set up my Windows computer to dual-boot into Ubuntu Jammy 22.04. There are many youtube videos on how to do this, here is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXyN1aJYefc&t=1s).
3. Here is a quick overview of what to do, but I will lay it out step by step after.
![Recovery Mode](src/eartag_jetson/resources/j401_set_recovery.gif).
5. Connect a female to female jumper pin to force the device into forced recovery mode by connected the GND and FC Rec pins shown ![here](src/eartag_jetson/resources/jumper.png).
6. After you have set up dual boot on your host computer, boot into it.
7. Right click on your desktop, and click `Open in Terminal`, then `lsusb`. Make sure this device ID (For Orin Nano 8GB: 0955:7523 NVidia Corp) shows up ![here](src/eartag_jetson/resources/verify_recovery.png) If it shows up, it is properly connected.
8. You can now remove the recovery wire.
9. On your host computer in the terminal, install:
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user-static sshpass abootimg nfs-kernel-server libxml2-utils binutils -y
```
10. Download this [flashing script](https://seeedstudio88-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/youjiang_yu_seeedstudio88_onmicrosoft_com/EcyQPZeI9glGmENtN2a4A2oBizsgTMATEMEMZCPI06aWJg?e=ctPbmU).
11. This file should appear in your downloads, run these commmands:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nano-8g-j401-6.2-36.4.3-2025-04-07.tar.gz
```
Now navigiate into the unpacked folder:
```bash
cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```
Now you wait for this message, this script can vary from 2~10 minutes long.
![Success](src/eartag_jetson/resources/successful_flash.png)
12. Now you are done with the host computer, connect the J401 to a display using the HDMI connector on the board and finish the initial configuration setup, you should just be able to continue with all options ![setup_desktop](src/eartag_jetson/resources/setup_desktop.png)
13. Now the Jetson should be all set up!

Parameters to adjust:

| Variable             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EDGE_MARGIN = 500`  | Ignores detections within 500 pixels from the **left or right edge** of the frame to avoid partial or spurious readings.                                                                     |
| `FRAME_WIDTH = 4608` | Specifies the full **horizontal resolution** of the input video frame in pixels. Used for boundary checks with `EDGE_MARGIN`.                                                                |
| `CLOSE_THRESH = 250` | Defines the maximum pixel distance in the **x-direction** to consider two detections as **"close duplicates"** that should be merged (helps reduce OCR noise or overlapping bounding boxes). |


| Variable             | Meaning                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TOP_N = N`          | Only the **top N most frequent tags** (after filtering and merging) are retained in the final summary. If there are 4 cows, N = 4.                                          |
| `MIN_DETECTIONS = N` | N amount of ear tag detections must be present before calling `run_milking_session` N .                           |
| `STREAK_THRESH = N` | Minimum number of **consecutive frames** where a tag must persist to be considered part of an active milking session â€” helps detect entry/start. Currently using N=50 with a 10fps video -> 5s of low detections.|
